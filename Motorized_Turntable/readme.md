This is the motorized turntable design I modified over to 608 bearings and added a grub screw to positively affix the table to the motor.

It was also re-implemented in Sketchup. I can post the Sketchup files as well if anyone would find those useful.

You can find it in the Prusa Printing repository: https://www.prusaprinters.org/prints/13776-photo-turntable-motorized-608-bearing and Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4037914

It's based on a design by Silent Bob that can be found on Thingiverse: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1826589

Changelog:
v1.3  19/12/15  Added rigidity, there's now a lip on the table to make better contact with the bearings.
