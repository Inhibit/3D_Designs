I couldn't quite find what I liked for a SMD parts reel on Thingiverse so I've made my own.

This one's got a simple notch for alignment of the two halves, a 3mm screw hole (which'll probably work with a 1/8 SAE wood or self tapping screw). It also has the center design of a normal industry reel which should be nice if I upgrade to a pick & place for my spools.

This is a 180mm SMD Reel for spooling up your 9mm SMD parts tape on a plastic roll.

Features include:
Common 9mm width
Single 3mm or 1/8 screw hole attachment
Positioning standoff (only requires one screw)
Notch to assist in rolling your spool
Standard three-prong interior that might even conform to Electronic Industries Association (EIA) Standard 481
