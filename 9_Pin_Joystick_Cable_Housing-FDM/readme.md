These files are for my 9 pin connection housing for the old joysticks from the first and second gen consoles and similar era computers.

Such as the Commodore 64, Sega Genesis, Sega Master System, Sega Megadrive, Amiga, ColecoVision, Atari, and probably others.

This is the design for FDM with a press fit housing with push-in two piece strain relief. If it's popular I'll add some redesigns.

Eventually I'll be designing a resin printer model with push-pin designs with a tighter fitting adapter more akin to the OEM.

You may need to increase the size of the housing (9_Pin_Jack_Case-15mm_Deep.stl) slightly to ease fitting it together. A bit of hot glue should do the trick to encase the cable end and provide good strain relief if this is necessary.
