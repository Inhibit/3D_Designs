This is a 120mm SMD Reel for spooling up your SMD parts on their plastic rolls.

Features include:
3mm or 1/8 screw hole
Positioning standoff (only requires one screw)
Notch to assist in rolling your spool
Standard three-prong interior that might even conform to Electronic Industries Association (EIA) Standard 481

I intend to add in other reel sizes as well.
