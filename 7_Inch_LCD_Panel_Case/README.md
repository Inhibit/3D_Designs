It should be printed with full supports. Printing in PLA at 20% infill created a solid working part.

Mark 2 is now up and the original "fixed" case is marked as derivative should you need it. 

03/04/19: Added in modified case for the 800023 daughterboard with control buttons

03/06/19: Replaced daughterboard case with the Mk2 variant that uses clips to hold on the display bezel.
