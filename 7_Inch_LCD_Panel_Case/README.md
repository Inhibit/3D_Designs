This is based on a 7" monitor case by swehacker. Link: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1160808

I've corrected the stand-offs so that they're now attached to the main portion of the body.

It should be printed with full supports. Printing in PLA at 20% infill created a solid working part.

Version 2, should I have time to create it, will be a complete re-work with mounting brackets using the swehacker case as reference for the openings.
