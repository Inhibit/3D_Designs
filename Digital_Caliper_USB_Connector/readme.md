These are connectors for the digital output found on Chinese sourced digital calipers. They're intended to be used with 22 guage copper wire as pins.

Printing this design is probably easiest with a 0.25 nozzle. A 0.4 nozzle may be too wide to lay down the fine fingers on this adapter.

Currently I'm using this adapter with the Link setup created here: https://pcburn.com/digital-caliper-via-usb-vernier-for-dro-just-3/

And the basis for the software I'm working on is here: https://github.com/MakingStuffChannel/DigitalCalipers (Thanks to MakingStuffChannel for figuring out the signaling on the calipers and releasing sample code!)
